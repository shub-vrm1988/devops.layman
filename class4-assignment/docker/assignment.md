This assigment is for running docker-engine on my aws ec2-instance named as devops.layman  

For this assigment, we have created a dummy flask application in python using claude.
During local installation of this Flask app, I have installed the requirements and successfully ran "python app.py" locally.

#For installating multiple application, can we achiveved in single line by creating a requirment text file and mention the name of application with version number and can be run using "-r"
E.g. Here we have installed the python based Flask and Werkzeug using "pip install -r requirements.

Initially locally ran the Flask application.
